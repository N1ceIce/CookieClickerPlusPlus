## Compiling:

Download and install [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15) with the following components:

* VC++ 2017 version 15.9 v14.16 latest v141 tools

* Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable Update

* MSBuild

* Visual Studio C++ core features

* Windows 10 SDK (10.0.16299.0) for Desktop C++ [x86 and x64]

Then, open `CookieClickerPlusPlus.sln` using Visual Studio. Once the solution loads, change the build type found under the top bar from "Debug" to "Release". Set the architecture to x86 if you are using a 32 bit computer, or x64 if you are using a 64 bit computer. Select "Build" from from the top bar, and choose "Build Solution" from the drop down menu. 

Once the executable is built, it will be found in either `/Release` or `/x64/Release` depending on which architecture you choose. The created folder can be found in the same directory as `CookieClickerPlusPlus.sln`.
